# SAS_SQL
The down side is that SAS is expensive, SQL is free. SQL is just a language for querying a database of table or tables (relational). SAS has a PROC called SQL where you can use the language to query SAS data sets. SQL is just a language. SAS implements that language via PROC SQL.
The SAS used here is SAS University edition.
